# Docker Practice Projects
This document contains hands-on Docker projects designed to help you practice containerization concepts. The projects involve packaging Python applications into Docker images, managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose, and deploying applications with dependencies like PostgreSQL. Each project includes step-by-step instructions and deliverables to reinforce practical learning. ðŸš€

# Docker Practice Project 1: Containerizing a Streamlit Application
# Project Overview
 You have developed a Streamlit application with the following functionalities:

A user interface to upload CSV files.
Once a CSV file is uploaded, the application displays:
The first five rows of the dataset.
Summary statistics of numerical columns.
Your manager has tasked you with containerizing this application using Docker so it can be easily deployed in a production environment. Additionally, you need to publish the Docker image on Docker Hub to allow other team members to pull and run it on their machines.

Task Instructions
1. Setup Project Environment
Create a new project directory on your local machine and navigate into it:
mkdir docker_practice_project && cd docker_practice_project
Clone this repository into the project folder:
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_name>
2. Write a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the project directory to package the application into a Docker image. The Dockerfile should meet the following requirements:

âœ… Use a lightweight Python base image.
âœ… Copy and install application dependencies from requirements.txt.
âœ… Copy the application code into the image.
âœ… Expose port 8501 to allow access to the Streamlit app.
âœ… Set the container's entrypoint to run the application using:

streamlit run <path/filename.py>
âœ… Follow Docker build best practices to leverage Dockerâ€™s build cache for efficient image creation.

3. Build and Run the Docker Image
Build the Docker image, naming it appropriately:

Run a container from the image, mapping port 8501 from the container to the host:

Verify the application is running:

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8501
Upload the student.csv file (available in the repository) to confirm that the application processes data as expected.
4. Publish the Image to Docker Hub
Log in to Docker Hub (if not already logged in):

Tag the image to match your Docker Hub repository:

Push the image to Docker Hub

Deliverables
To complete the task, submit the following:

Your Dockerfile.
A link to your Docker Hub repository containing the published image.
Happy Dockerizing! ðŸš€





# Docker Practice Project 2: Creating a Multi-container Application
# Project Overview
You have developed a Streamlit application with the following functionalities:

A user interface for CSV file upload.
Once a CSV file is uploaded, the application loads it into a PostgreSQL database table for persistence.
The application reads the loaded data from the PostgreSQL database table.
The application displays the first 5 rows and the summary statistics of the numerical columns in the table.
The application is implemented in the data_process_db.py script in this repository.

Since this application requires a PostgreSQL database, you need to run a PostgreSQL container and connect to it from the container running your application. To achieve this, you will create a multi-container application using Docker Compose.

Task
Your manager has tasked you with:

Packaging this application and its dependencies into a Docker image for easy deployment.
Pushing the application image to Docker Hub so team members can easily download and run it.
Creating a multi-container setup using Docker Compose.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Set Up Your Project

Create a new folder on your PC and navigate into it.
Clone this repository into the new folder.
Create and Write a Dockerfile

Package the application into a Docker image.
Use a lightweight Python image as the base image.
Copy and install the application dependencies (requirements.txt).
Copy the application code into the image.
Expose port 8501 for the application.
Set the container's entrypoint to run the application using:
streamlit run <path/filename.py>
Ensure the Dockerfile follows best practices to leverage Docker build caching.
Create Docker Compose Configuration

Create a compose.yml file.
Define services to run the multi-container application:
Application Service
Uses the build key to refrence the Dockerfile you created.
Binds host port 8501 to container port 8501.
Defines the following environment variables:
environment:
  POSTGRES_HOST: app-db
  POSTGRES_USER: postgres
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
  POSTGRES_DB: postgres
  POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
Depends on the database service.
Database Service
Uses a lightweight PostgreSQL image.
Defines the following environment variable:
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
Persists database data using Docker volumes.
Run the Multi-Container Application

Start your application using Docker Compose
Access the Web Application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
Upload the student.csv file available in this repo.
Confirm the application works as expected.
Verify Database Persistence

Execute into your database container:
docker exec -it <database_container_id> psql -U postgres
Run the following SQL command to confirm the uploaded data is present:
SELECT * FROM student;
Push Your Application Image to Docker Hub

Tag and push your Docker image to Docker Hub
Deliverables
Submit your Dockerfile and compose.yml file.
Provide a link to your Docker image on Docker Hub.
Happy Dockerizing! ðŸš€
